### Todos to promote to issues:
- [ ] - Rename functions appropriately (they are recursive and should be named in a way that indicates so).
- [ ] - Expose other useful parts from internals (readDirectory, readLStat etc.)
- [ ] - Create iterable types for use with `yield` and or `for..of` comprehensions.
